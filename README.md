# quantopian_IPO_strategy
Abstract:

We develop a strategy built upon the findings of Amini & Singal (2020) which established that upward drifts of stock price resulting from stock buybacks persist
for a minimum of 60 days. In light of this, we investigated the profitability of a long-only trading strategy, taking a long position in shares of U.S. listed
companies that announce stock buybacks for a 60-day period post-buyback announcements, we find that our strategy produces, on average, 21.22% abnormal returns
annually when benchmarked against the S&P500 over a period of 14 months.
